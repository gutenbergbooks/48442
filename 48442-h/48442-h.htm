<p class="drop-cap">SHE was neither witty, nor learned in books, nor wise in
the ways of the world, but I contend that her life was
noble. There was something in her unconscious heroism
which transcends wisdom and the deeds of those who dwell in
the rose-golden light of romance. Now that her life is rounded
into the silence whence it came, its significance appears.</p>

<p>To me she was never young, for I am her son, and as I first
remember her she was a large, handsome, smiling woman—deft
and powerful of movement, sweet and cheery of smile and
voice. She played the violin then, and I recall how she used
to lull me to sleep at night with simple tunes like “Money
Musk” and “Dan Tucker.” She sang, too, and I remember
her clear soprano rising out of the singing of the Sunday congregation
at the schoolhouse with thrilling sweetness and charm.
Her hair was dark, her eyes brown, her skin fair and her lips
rested in lines of laughter.</p>

<p>Her first home was in Greene’s Coolly, in La Crosse County,
Wisconsin, and was only a rude little cabin with three rooms
and a garret. The windows of the house overlooked a meadow
and a low range of wooded hills to the east. In this house she
lived alone during two years of the Civil War while my father
went as a volunteer into the Army of the Tennessee. My
memory of these times is vague but inset with charm. Though
my mother worked hard she had time to visit with her neighbors
and often took her children with her to quilting bees, which
they enjoyed, for they could play beneath the quilt as if it were
a tent, and run under it for shelter from imaginary storms. I
feel again her strong, soft, warm arms as she shielded me at
nightfall from menacing wolves and other terrible creatures.
When the world grew mysterious and vast and thick-peopled
with yawning monsters eager for little men and women, she
gathered us to her bosom and sang us through the gates of sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
into a golden land of dreams. We never knew how she longed
for the return of her blue-coated soldier.</p>

<p>Our stove was a high-stepper, with long bent legs, and bore
its oven on its back as a dromedary his hump. Under its arch
I loved to lie watching my mother as she trod to and fro about
her work in the kitchen. She taught me to read while working
thus—for I was constantly interrupting her by asking the
meaning of words in the newspaper which I had smuggled under
the stove beneath me.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MY father’s return from the war brought solace and happiness,
but increased her labors, for he set to work with
new zeal to widen his acres of plow-land.</p>

<p>I have the sweetest recollections of my mother’s desire to
make us happy each Christmas-time, and to this end she planned
jokes for herself and little surprises for us. We were desperately
poor in those days, for my father was breaking the tough
sod of the natural meadows and grubbing away trees from the
hillside, “opening a farm,” as he called it, and there was hardly
enough extra money to fill three stockings with presents. So
it came about that mother’s stocking often held more rags and
potatoes than silks or silverware. But she always laughed and
we considered it all very good fun then. Its pathos makes my
heart ache now.</p>

<p>She was a neighborly woman. She had no enemies. I don’t
believe any one ever spoke an unkind word of Belle Garland as
she was called—she was always sunny—her little petulances
passed quickly like small summer showers and then she laughed—shook
with laughter while the tears shone on her face. I
can see now that she was only a big, handsome girl, but she was
my mother, and as such seemed an “old person.”</p>

<p>Her physical strength was very great. I have heard my
father say that at the time he went away to war she was his
equal in many contests, and I know she was very deft and skillful
in her work. She could cut and fit and finish the calico
dress purchased in the morning of the same day. She cooked
with the same adroitness, and though her means were meagre
everything she made tasted good. She liked nothing better than
to have her neighbors drop in to tea or dinner.</p>

<p>After all, I do not remember very much of her life while we
lived in this Coolly—nor while in Winnesheik County, Iowa,
whereto we moved in 1869. She remained of the same physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
dignity to me, and though she grew rapidly heavier and older
I did not realize it. My second sister Jessie came to us while
living in an old log house in a beautiful wood just west of
Hesper, and I now know that my mother never recovered from
the travail of this birth—though she returned to her domestic
duties as before and was to her children the jolly personality
she had always been. While living on this farm smallpox came
to our family and we were all smitten with this much-dreaded
disease, but mother not only nursed her baby and took care of
us all, but she also smiled down into our faces without apparent
anxiety—though some of us lay at death’s door for weeks.
Shortly after we recovered from this we moved again to the
newer West.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DON’T know what her feelings were about these constant
removals to the border, but I suspect now that each
new migration was a greater hardship than those which
preceded it. My father’s adventurous and restless spirit was
never satisfied. The sunset land always allured him, and my
mother, being of those who follow their husbands’ feet without
complaining word, seemed always ready to take up the trail.
With the blindness of youth and the spirit of seeking which I
inherited I saw no tear on my mother’s face. I inferred that
she, too, was eager and exalted at the thought of “going West.”
I now see that she must have suffered each time the bitter
pangs of doubt and unrest which strike through the woman’s
heart when called upon to leave her snug, safe fire for a ruder
cabin in strange lands.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SHE had four children at this time and I fear her boys
gave her considerable trouble, but her eldest daughter
was of growing service in working about the house as
well as in tending the fair-haired baby, but work grew harder
and harder. My father purchased some wild land in Mitchell
County, Iowa, and we all set to work to break the sod for the
third time. A large part of the hardship involved in this fell
upon my mother, for the farm required a great many “hands,”
and these “hands” had enormous appetites, and the household
duties grew more unrelenting from year to year.</p>

<p>Our new house was a small one with but three rooms below
and two above, but it had a little lean-to which served as a
summer kitchen. It was a bare home, with no touch of grace
other than that given by my mother’s cheery presence. Her
own room was small and crowded, but as she never found time
to occupy it save to sleep I hope it did not trouble her as it does
me now as I look back to it.</p>

<p>Each year, as our tilled acres grew, churning and washing
and cooking became harder, until at last it was borne in upon
my boyish mind that my mother was condemned to never-remitting
labor. She was up in the morning before the light cooking
breakfast for us all, and she seldom went to bed before my
father. She was not always well and yet the work had to be
done. We all worked in those days; even my little sister ran
on errands, and perhaps this was the reason why we did not
realize more fully the grinding weight of drudgery which fell
on this pioneer’s wife. But Harriet was growing into a big
girl and began to materially aid my mother, though she brought
an added expense in clothing and schooling. We had plenty
of good wholesome things to eat in those days, but our furniture
remained poor. Our little sitting-room was covered with
a rag carpet which we children helped to make, tearing, sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and winding rags during the winter nights. I remember helping
mother to dye them also, and in the spring she made her own
soap. This also I helped to do.</p>

<p>Churning and milking we boys did for her, and the old up
and down churn was a dreaded beast to us as it was to all the
boys of the countryside; and yet I knew mother ought not to do
such work, and I went to the dasher regularly but with a wry
face. Father was not niggardly of labor-saving implements,
and a clotheswringer and washer and a barrel churn came along
and they helped a little, but work never “lets up” on a farm.
There are always three meals to get and the dishes to wash,
and each day is like another so far as duties are concerned.
Sunday brings little rest for housewives even in winter.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_b.jpg" width="45" height="54" alt="B"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BUT into those monotonous days some pleasure came. The
neighbors dropped in of a summer evening, and each
Sunday we drove away to church. In winter we attended
all the “ly-ceums” and church “sociables,” and took part
in occasional “surprise parties.” In all these neighborhood jollities
my mother had a generous hand. Her coming always
added to the fun. “Here comes Mrs. Garland!” some one
would say, and every face shone brighter because of her smile.
She was ever ready to help on the gayety in any way, and
was always in voice to sing, provided some one else started the
song to give her courage. She loved games, practical jokes and
jesting of all kinds. Her natural gayety was almost unquenchable;
not even unending work and poverty could entirely subdue
her or embitter her.</p>

<p>Death touching her eldest daughter threw the first enduring
shadow over her life. She never entirely returned to the jollity
of her former years, though she regained a cheerfulness inseparable
from her life. She had been youthful to that moment;
after that she was middle-aged—even to her sons.</p>

<p>Her two boys and her baby Jessie comforted her and she had
no time for unavailing grief. As she had sent her daughter to
school, so now she urged her sons to study, for though a woman
of little schooling herself she had a firm belief in the value of
learning. She took strong ground in my behalf, and I have
many dear recollections of her quiet support of my plans for an
education. In this I owe her much. My father felt the need
of my services too keenly to instantly grant me leave of absence,
but together they made sacrifices to send me to school as they
had sent my sister before me, and as they were willing to send
those who came after me. At sixteen I began to attend a seminary
in the town, six miles away.</p>

<p>These were my happiest days, and I hope I carried something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of my larger outlook back to my mother. I boarded
myself for several terms in a fashion common among the boys
of the school, and mother’s pies and doughnuts and “self-rising”
bread enabled me to sustain life joyously from Monday morning
till Friday night. She never seemed to tire of doing little
things for my comfort, and I took them, I fear, with the carelessness
of youth, never thinking of the pain they cost. I did
not even perceive how swiftly she was growing old. She still
shook with laughter over my tales of school life and sent me
away each week with the products of her loving labor.</p>

<p>She heard my graduation address with how much of pride
or interest I do not know, for she never expressed her deeper
feelings. She seldom kissed her children, and after we grew
to be boys of twelve or fourteen, too large to snuggle in her
arms, she never embraced us, though I think she liked to have us
come and lay our heads in her lap. She still continued to
threaten to “trounce” us, a menace which always provoked us
to laughter. “Mother’s whippings don’t last long,” we used
to say.</p>

<p>Our home remained unchanged. The expense of opening a
farm, of buying machinery and building barns, made it seem
necessary to live in the same little story-and-a-half house. The
furniture grew shabbier, but was not replaced. My mother’s
dresses were always cheap and badly made, but so were the
coats my father wore. Money seemed hard to hold, even when
the crops were good. I cannot recall a single beautiful thing
about our house, not one. The sunlight and the songs of birds,
the flame of winter snow, the blaze of snow-crystals, I clearly
call to mind, but the house I remember only as a warm shelter,
where my mother strove to feed and clothe us. But as nearly
all other homes of the neighborhood were of like character I
don’t suppose she realized her own poverty.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.jpg" width="52" height="55" alt="A"/>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AT last a great change came to us all. The country was
fairly filled with settlers and my father’s pioneer heart
began to stir again, and once more he planned a flight
into the wilder West, and in the fall of 1881, when I was
twenty-one years of age, we parted company. My parents and
my sister and brother journeyed westward into South Dakota
and settled in the little town of Ordway, on a treeless plain,
while I turned eastward, intent on further education.</p>

<p>I mention this going especially because, when it became certain
that my people were leaving never to return, the neighbors
thronged about the house one August day to say good-by,
and with appropriate speeches presented mother with some
silver and glassware. These were the first nice dishes she had
ever owned and she was too deeply touched to speak a word of
thanks. But the givers did not take so much virtue to themselves.
Some of them were women who had known the touch
of my mother’s hand in sickness and travail. Others had seen
her close the eyes of their dead—for she had come to be a
mother to every one who suffered. Those who brought the
richest gifts considered them a poor return for her own unstinting
helpfulness.</p>

<p>I shall always remember that day. I was about to “go forth
into the world,” as our graduating orations had declared we
should do. My people were again adventuring into strange
lands—leaving the house they had built, the trees they had
planted and the friends they had drawn around them. The
vivid autumnal sun was shining over all the lanes we had learned
to love and sifting through the leaves of the trees that had
grown up around us. The familiar faces of the bronzed and
wrinkled old farmers were tremulous with emotion. The
women frankly wept on each other’s bosoms—and in the hush
of that golden day I heard the sound of wings—the wings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the death-angel whose other name is Time. I knew we would
never return to this place: that the separation of friends there
beginning would last forever. The future was luminous before
me, but its forms were too vague to be delineated. I turned
my face eastward with a thought in my brain beating like the
clock of the ages. In such moments the past becomes beautiful,
the future a menace.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS story does not concern itself with my wanderings,
but with the life of my mother. When I saw her again
she was living in a small house beside my father’s store in
Ordway, South Dakota. She had not changed perceptibly, and
she had won a new and wide circle of friends. She was “Mrs.
Garland” now, and not Belle—but she was the life of every
social, and her voice was still marvelously clear and vibrant in
song. She was a little heavier, a little older, but her face had
the same sweet curves about the mouth and chin. Life was a
little easier for her, too. She was clear of the farm and its
terrible drudgery at last. She could sleep like a human being
till daylight came, for she had no one to cook for save her own
small family. She saw and was a part of the village life, which
was exceedingly jolly and of good report. Her son Franklin
and her little daughter were still with her, and she did not
much miss her eldest—who had gone far seeking fair cities in
intellectual seas. The home was still poor and shabby of
furniture, but it was not lonely. Mother missed, but no longer
mourned, her vanished friends.</p>

<p>I did not see her again for nearly four years, and my heart
contracted with a sudden pain at sight of her. She was growing
old. Her hair was gray, and as she spoke, her voice was
weak and tremulous. She was again on the farm and working
as of old—like one on a treadmill. My father, too, was old.
He had not prospered. A drought had swept over the fair
valley and men on all sides were dropping away into despair.
Jessie was at home—the only one of all the children. The
house was a little better than any my mother had owned before,
but it was a poor, barren place for all that.</p>

<p>Old as she was, and suffering constantly from pain in her
feet and ankles, she was still mother to every one who suffered.
Even while I was there she got up on two demands in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
middle of the night and rode away across the plain in answer
to some suffering woman’s call for help. She knew death intimately.
She had closed the eyes of many a world-weary wife
or suffering child, and more than once a poor outcast woman
of the town, sick and alone, felt the pitying touch of her lips.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAW with greater clearness than ever before the lack of
beauty in her life. She had a few new things, but they
were all cheap and poor. She now had one silk dress—which
her son had sent her. All else was calico. But worse
than all was the bleak, burning, wind-swept plain—treeless,
scorched and silent save for the song of the prairie lark. I
felt the monotony of her surroundings with greater keenness
than ever before.</p>

<p>I was living in Boston at that time, and having heard many
of the great singers I was eager to test my mother’s voice with
the added knowledge I had of such things. Even then, weakened
as she was and without training or practice, she still possessed
a compass of three octaves and one note, and was able to
sing one complete octave above the ordinary soprano voice with
every note sweet and musical. I have always believed that a
great singer was lost to the world in this pioneer’s wife.</p>

<p>One day as I sat writing in the sitting-room I heard a strange
cry outside—a cry for help. I rushed out into the yard, and
there just outside the door in the vivid sunlight stood my mother,
unable to move—a look of fear and horror on her face.
The black-winged angel had sent her his first warning. She
was paralyzed in the lower limbs. I carried her to her bed with
a feeling that her life was ended there on the lonely plain, and
my heart was bitter and rebellious and my mind filled with self-accusations.
If she died now—here—what would she know
of the great world outside? Her life had been always on the
border—she knew nothing of civilization’s splendor of song
and story. She would go away from the feast without a crumb.
All her toilsome, monotonous days rushed through my mind
with a roar, like a file of gray birds in the night—how little—how
tragically small her joys, and how black her sorrows,
her toil, her tedium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>It chanced that a physician friend was visiting us at the time
and his skill reassured me a little. The bursting of a minute
blood-vessel in the brain had done the mischief. A small clot
had formed, he said, which must either grow or be re-absorbed.
He thought it would be re-absorbed and that she would slowly
recover.</p>

<p>This diagnosis proved to be correct and in a few days she
was able to sit up, and before I returned to Boston she could
walk a little, though she could not lift her feet from the floor.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">OUR parting at this time was the most painful moment
of my life. I had my work to do in Boston. I could
earn nothing out on the plain, so I must go, but I
promised it would not be for long. In my heart I determined
that the remainder of her life should be freer from care and
fuller of joy. I resolved to make a home for her in some more
hospitable land, but the cling of her arms to my neck remained
with me many days.</p>

<p>She gained slowly, and a year later was able to revisit the
scenes of her girlhood in Wisconsin. In two years she was able
to go to California with me. She visited the World’s Fair in
Chicago, and her sons wheeled her about the grounds as if to
say: “Mother, you have pioneered enough; henceforth fold your
hands and rest and be happy.”</p>

<p>She entered now upon another joy—the quiet joy of reminiscence,
for the old hard days of pioneering on the Iowa prairie
grew mellow with remembered sunshine—the storms grew
faint and vague. She loved to sit and dream of the past. She
loved to recall old faces, and to hear us tell of old times and
old neighbors. Beside the glow of her fire she had a keen delight
in the soughing of the winds in the grim pines of Wisconsin,
the flame of lightning in the cyclonic nights in Iowa,
and the howling blasts of stern blizzards on the wide Dakota
sod. She came back to old friends in “the Coolly Country of
Wisconsin,” and there her sons built a roomy house about her.
They put nice rugs under her feet and new silver on her table.
It was all on a very humble scale, but it made her eyes misty
with happy tears. For eleven years after her first stroke she
lived with us in this way—or we with her. And my father,
was glad of the shelter and the comfort, for he, too, admitted
growing age and joined with his sons in making the wife happy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAVE a purpose in this frank disclosure of my mother’s
life. It is not from any self-complacency, God knows,
for I did so little and it came so late—I write in the
hope of making some other work-weary mother happy. There
is nothing more appealing to me than neglected age. To see an
old father or mother sitting in loneliness and poverty dreaming
of an absent son who never comes, of a daughter who never
writes, is to me more moving than Hamlet or Othello. If we
are false to those who gave us birth we are false indeed.</p>

<p>Most of us in America are the children of working people,
and the toil-worn hands of our parents should be heaped to
overflowing with whatever good things success brings to us.
They bent to the plow and the washboard when we were helpless.
They clothed us when clothing was bought with blood,
and we should be glad to return this warmth, this protection,
an hundredfold. Fill their rooms with sunshine and the odor
of flowers—you sons and daughters of the pioneers of America.
Gather them around you, let them share in your success,
and when some one looks askance at them stand beside them
and say: “These gray old heads, these gnarled limbs, sheltered
me in days when I was weak and life was stern.”</p>

<p>Then will the debt be lessened—for in such coin alone can
the wistful hearts be paid.</p>
